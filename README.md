  Crafted SQL payloads to extract usernames, hashed passwords, and database schema information.

- **💥 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
  Successfully executed Reflected, Stored, and DOM-based XSS attacks to demonstrate client-side vulnerabilities.

- **🔐 Brute Force Attack**  
  Simulated a brute-force login attack using **Burp Suite Intruder** to crack weak credentials.
